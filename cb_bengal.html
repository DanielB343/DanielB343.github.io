       <img src="cb_photo3.png" alt="" />
       <p> The Bangle cat may not look like the normal domestic cat
	       however it it is one of the more popular breeds for cat lovers. 
		   These cats look like they came out of the wild jungle which 
		   gives them a unique edge compared to the other cat breeds.</p>
       <p> Even though these cats are really great to have as pets they 
	       take a lot of work to care for them which can be hard for people
		   who are not used to having a cat. Owning this breed takes a lot 
		   of experience and dedication so best to be prepared when getting one.</p>

      <article>
         <h1>Physical Aspects</h1>
         <p>Bangle cats are slender cats usually weighing around 8-18 pounds
		    depending on the gender. They are 14 to 18 inches making them
			one of the bigger cat breeds even if they are far from the 
			largest. Bangle has a short-length tabby coat with an exotic 
			look to it with its red-brown spotted or swirled patterns. 
			Their coat also have an extremely soft and silky touch to it 
			making it very nice to pet it when it lets you.</p>

         <h1>Personality</h1>
         <p>Bangle cats are very intelligent and playful cat that
		  like the attention they get from their owners. 
		  These cats are always active and energetic anywhere 
		  you go and will always be curious about things that 
		  interest them. Bangle are very affectionate to their
		  owners making them easy to play mate but be warned you 
		  may need to take a lot of time to play with them.
		  Lastly, they are more adventurous when it comes to 
		  new things even more than other cats, for example

		  or in water. Whatever fills their activity needs 
		  the Bangle cat will most likely do.</p>

         <h1>Health and Grooming</h1>
         <p>Thanks to the bangle's shorter coat, these cats are
		 very easy to groom. Just brush their hair once in a while
         and a bath won't hurt them since they might like it.		 
         These cats are expected to live up to 12 to 16 years but
		 with the popular care, they may surpass this for a couple of years. 
		 An important health factor to keep in check is their oral
		 hygiene since it easy for this cat to get gum disease. 
		 This cat may also get hip dysplasia or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 
		 in the kneecaps which may require surgery to fix it.</p>

         <h1>History</h1>
         <p>This breed of cat was created due to a mix breeding of a domestic cat
		 and an Asian leopard in the 1960s. The owner only did this because the 
		 leopard she bought was lonely so she got her a male cat partner to be with, 
		 which led these two cats to breed and make a generation of new type of breed.
		 The first couple of generations show more wild accepts to them  but as more 
		 generations of breeding went through they started to act like the breed we know today.</p>
